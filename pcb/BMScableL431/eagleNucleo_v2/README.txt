eagleNucleo_v2--

Revises eagleNucleo layout:

1. Relay coil +/- in eagleNucleo backwards.

eagleNucleo part layout is correct if the relay
is mounted from the bottom side of the pcb, but
placed in eagle as top mounted.

A revised part, EC2-A was made with the correct
pinouts, for top mounting. 

2. Add pins for easy VOM connection.
